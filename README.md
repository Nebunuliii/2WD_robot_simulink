This project simulates the control of a 2-wheeled robot (2WD), using a PID controller to follow a mathematical trajectory. The platform used is MATLAB & Simulink.

### Features:
- 2WD model created in Simulink with Simscape blocks
- PID control for controlling the speed and position of the motors
- Trajectory defined with position vectors and angles
- Feedback with simulated sensors (encoders + IMU)
- Positioning error and stability analysis
